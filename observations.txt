After careful observation of these domain names we can observe a few things-
1. There are mainly 2 types of domain names-
  a. imp-xx-electricimp.com
  b. prdxxx.boxen.electricimp.com
  Exception in May2021- upgrades.electricimp.com (may be because Software is getting updated)

2. imp-xx.... domain name changes only after May (when there was upgrades domain name)

3. One of prdxxx format domain name is present for consecutive 2 months, so 1 such domain name is common in 2 months
